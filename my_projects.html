                    <p>For this first project, I managed to successfully process multiple csv files containing data about the weather, converting them into meaningful text-based summaries. To do so, I created several functions in order to: convert temperatures, format dates, calculate mean, max and min values, store data with specific parameters as well as create general and daily summaries formatted with specific instructions. I then run every function against set tests to ensure that code written had the expected behavior and could be correct for a variety of different inputs. </p>

                    <p>As a second project, I started my first fully self-coded website portfolio. It’s based on three main pages: home (about me) page, my projects and a contact page. This website is mostly built with HTML and styled with CSS. Just a tiny bit of JavaScript has been used to create a sort of ripple/click effect on every button (anchors). The website has also been linked to external pages such us: my GitHub repository for every project completed as well as my LinkedIn profile. Lots of work still need to be done and many ideas still need to be implemented. It’s still very simple and fairly static but as my coding skills improve so will my website. </p>
